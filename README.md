# Data Platform for Quantitative Research

This project is a collaborative effort to design and implement a data platform that simplifies the workflow for quantitative researchers. It includes:

- **Data Lake**: A scalable storage solution for raw and processed data.
- **Data Catalog**: Metadata-rich inventory for dataset discovery.
- **Data Workbench**: Tools for data transformation and preparation.
- **Quant Data Models**: Standardized models for structured data access.

## Components
- `src/`: Contains Python implementations of each platform component.
- `docs/`: Documentation and user guides.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for platform functionalities.

## How to Collaborate
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/data-platform-quant-research.git
